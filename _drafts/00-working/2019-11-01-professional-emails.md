Title: Summary of meeting with Polish customer
 
Hi Liona,
 
I hope you are well!
 
We had a very long meeting with Polish customers yesterday. The meeting was good,
but very slow. They wanted to discuss every little point.
 
Also, you were right about the schedule. They took away the list of deadlines and they are going to consider it and make their suggestions.
 
Mr. Bujak will get an answer by the end of the week. 
Will get back to us by the end of the week. (Will provide an answer/Will provide a response)

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need additional information.

See you!
