Hi Evgenia,

I hope you are having a great day!

Previously, I had asked you for the end of the month report on November 8th.
Unfortunately, I just had a meeting with my director, Donnie, and he is now requesting the report a week earlier.

Could you please send me the report on November 1?
    
I would really appreciate it.
Please let me know if you are unable to do this.

Thank you, Yuliya.

Hi Yulia!

I am responding to your email and unfortunately I am swamped today.

There is just no way I am available to prepare the requested report by tomorrow. I have several other deadlines tomorrow. Could I send it to you by end of day Monday?
    
Best, Evgenia.
