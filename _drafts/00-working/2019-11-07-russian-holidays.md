# Russian holidays

## Unity Day - November 4th

Unity Day is the young holiday. It was first celebrated on November 4th 2005.

A lot of people in Russia don't know what exactly the holiday means. It's just holiday to sleep and not work :)

By history, Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky united people and ejected the Polish invaders in 17th century, exactly in November 1612.
