## TODO -> I haven't VS I don't have

**I haven’t or I don’t have**

**Have** is an interesting verb in that it serves many purposes. 

Can be used as an auxiliary verb and the main verb

Used as an auxiliary verb or helping verb

For example, when we use **have** to make perfect tense forms, we use it as an auxiliary verb. Examples are given below.

- I **have eaten** breakfast. when?
- She **has broken** her arm. When? Sometime in the past
- I **have seen** that film. Harriet

In the three sentences given above, **have** doesn’t really have a meaning. It merely helps the other verbs (eat, break and see) to form their present perfect tense forms.

**Have** can also be used an **ordinary (main) verb**. 

In this case, it has a meaning. The ordinary verb **have** is used to express ideas such as possession, personal characteristics, relationships etc.

I have a Toyota.

- He **has** a fleet of cars. (He owns those cars.)
- She **has** a nice personality. (Personal characteristics)
- They **have** a daughter. (Relationships)

In all of these three sentences, **have** is the main verb. **As you can see, there are no other verbs in these sentences.**

When **have** is used as an auxiliary verb, we make questions by putting it before the subject. It is quite simple.

- She **has written** a novel. (Statement)
- **Has** she **written** a novel? (Question)
- Did 

When **have** is used as an ordinary verb, we make questions and negative forms with **do.**

Study the examples given below.

- She **has** a daughter. (Statement)
- She **does not have** a daughter. (Negative) (NOT She hasn’t a daughter.)
- **Does** she **have** a daughter? (Question) (NOT Hasn’t she a daughter?)
- They **have** many friends.
- They **do not have** many friends.
- **Do** they **have** many friends? Have they many friends?
- I have no time. **I don’t have any time.** Don’t you have any time?

**Sometimes, you might hear people saying ‘She hasn’t a daughter’ or ‘I haven’t a car’, but remember that these forms are incorrect and very unusual.**

**Conjugate a verb collocations**

 Negative sentences in English require a helping verb to come before the word “not,” and when there is no other helping verb to be had, it’s “do” that steps in. So instead of just putting “no” or “not” at the beginning or the end of a sentence as many other languages do, English uses “do not” or “don’t.”

 

 **Must  and have to shows obligation**

I must talk to her before she leaves. Own decision

Must is more formal All passengers must have a ticket.

Use have to in spoken English. Must sounds strange.

I have to go to work tomorrow.  situational

**Must not and don’t have to are different**

Visitors must not touch the paintings.it’s forbidden

You don’t have to be here before ten. Not necessary but you  have a choice

Passengers must not talk to the driver while the bus is moving. Forbidden 

You don’t have to finish it today. Have a choice

**Should** is used for advice or give opinions not for obligations the person has a choice

You should go to bed earlier then you wouldn't feel so tired.

He should do more work if he wants to get promoted.

**Must can be used to give advice** You must try the fish.  It’s  delicious more emphatic stronger You really like the fish.

You have to try the fish.  It is delicious.

**When giving negative advice only use shouldn’t**   

You **shouldn't** take the job if you don’t like the long commute.Give advice or express an opinion

Don’t use mustn't don’t have to

**MUST**

Must **obligations** you feel strongly about

I must remember to get him a birthday present.

Obligations in formal written English

All employees must wash their hands.

**Strong advice**

You must read it. It is an amazing story.

**Saying something is forbidden**

Children must not  be left unattended.

In spoken English it is more common to say can’t

**Have to**

Obligations that depend on circumstances

I have to wear glasses because I can’t see so clearly.

Most obligations in spoken English

Do you have to work tomorrow?

Saying something is not necessary

You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.

Strong advice

**Angry South Korean football fans are seeking compensation after Cristiano Ronaldo failed to take to the pitch during a Juventus pre-season friendly.**

The superstar was contracted to play 45 minutes when the match against K League All Stars was announced, organisers say, but he stayed on the subs' bench.

Fans became angry when he made no sign of lacing up his boots, even chanting the name of his rival Lionel Messi.

Some have now reached out to Seoul law firm Myungan to file a lawsuit.

They are seeking compensation of 70,000 won (£48.50; $59) per ticket, 1,000 won for the ticket commission fee, and 1m won each for compensation for "mental anguish".

"Normally in such cases the plaintiffs will be refunded the price of the tickets, but I put this under a special case since the company, through false advertising, took advantage of the football star's fans," a lawyer from the firm told Reuters.

"As for the mental anguish part, I'd like to say some of them are raucous fans, the real avid fans. So for them it is very painful because they love Ronaldo and want to protect him, but they can't, given the situation," he added.

"For now we have two plaintiffs who sued the company, but I have been getting a lot of calls today and I assume there will be some 60,000 more."

Robin Chang, CEO of The Fasta, the Korean agency which arranged the game, broke down in tears to broadcaster SBS and confirmed that the contract stipulated the Portuguese star appear for 45 minutes.

However, Ms Chang said she only found out that the 34-year-old would not be making an appearance 10 minutes into the second half.

"When I went to argue with (Pavel) Nedved, the vice president of Juventus, all he said was 'I also wish Ronaldo ran, but he doesn't want to. Sorry, there's nothing I can do.' I was so frustrated," she said.

South Korea's professional football governing body, K League, said a letter of protest has been sent to the Italian champions for violating the contract.

Many fans have been voicing their anger at Ronaldo on social media.

"He betrayed the 60,000 audience and belittled us," a fan who attended the match posted on Instagram.

"I'm no longer a Ronaldo fan."

## Here is your topic for your extended speech

**Describe a website you often browse**

You should say:

- ***what is it***

- ***how long have you been using it***

- ***give details information about the website***

**and explain why you often browse this website.**

**Here is a sample speech to use as a guide:**

I will tell you what the website is, how long I’ve been using it, a bit about what is on it and why I visit it so often.

The website is the BBC news website. You can find it at [ www.bbc.co.uk/news](https://mail.lanit-tercom.com/owa/redir.aspx?REF=RllO8Rji4GVgTFxZaX6IQ8naClCgTFUcqHIXJkFBYiP_RwYNVhbXCAFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdz) but I just have it as a favourite on my toolbar. I am a complete BBC junkie! I visit the website several times a day if I can, and have been using it for as long as I can remember. Possibly for as long as the website has been in existence but definitely for the past ten years or more.

The BBC news website is massive. It contains rolling headlines of breaking news, and from the landing page, you can jump to sections on different types of news categories. For example, there are tabs for world news; health issues; environmental reports; education; sports; education and science as well as entertainment and arts stories. You can read just text-based articles illustrated with a few pictures – which is my preferred way of accessing news and information – or you can opt to see news film or audio clips. I think the website is really comprehensive and easy to use too.

The BBC news website, for me, is a one-stop location for all current affairs and news items. I really like that I can see the headlines of breaking news almost instantaneously, but it also includes more thoughtful reporting. Detailed online articles with considered analysis about global or local events.  I can also find out what the weather forecast is – always handy in the UK where it can change so quickly, plus I like to be able to keep an eye on what is happening locally to me in Sheffield where I live. I also trust the BBC website to give balanced reporting,  I think it has journalistic integrity, so I feel if I read it every day, I will have a good perspective on what is going on in the world, and enough information to come to my own conclusions on current affairs across the globe. The only downside of the website is that I find it can be a bit addictive! Because it is updated frequently it is tempting to keep going back and having another look if there is some running news item that I am following. It can lead me to procrastinate when I am supposed to be working, but I tell myself it is important to keep up to date with what is going on in the world, even though I know that really, it wouldn’t hurt to limit myself to news ‘fix’ just a couple of times a day!



## Google

### I'll try to give detail information about website, how long I've been using it, and a bit about what is on it.

The website is "Google". Of cause every user know about this website, 

I visit the website every time when I use my computer and have been using it for as long as I can remember. 

Possibly for as long as the website has been in existence but definitely for the past ten years or more.

### The main google feature is searching by Internet sites. 

I prefer google to different search engine like Yandex, Rambler, Yahoo and others. Google returns the most relevant search result for me.

### Also google gives free email account

I don't remember exactly how long I've been using email from google, but yearly I used mail.ru and rambler and others. **I can say the google's email is very convenient**.

### Google gives not only free email account

This account integrates with

- calendar
- notes
- tasks
- contacts
- and many different convenient tools, **google is comprehensive**. 

I use a lot of tools from google and it's awesome.

### I use google-calendar on my PC

and I integrated calendar with my mobile phone. It's very convenient to use from different devices.
