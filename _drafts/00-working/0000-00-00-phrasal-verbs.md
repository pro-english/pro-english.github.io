## Example Casual Conversation

**Melanie:** Hey Tyra! I was at Walmart the other day and you wouldn’t believe who I **ran into** (met unexpectedly)? 

**Tyra:** Who Mel? I am dying to find out! 

**Melanie:** My old boyfriend, Jeffrey!  

**Tyra:** OMG! What has he **been up**? (been doing). Wasn’t he studying to be an engineer? He was so smart in high school! He won a lot of awards and was voted “most likely to succeed”? Right? You were homecoming king and queen! I was so jealous! 

**Melanie**: No, he didn’t become an engineer. Plans didn’t work out for Jeffrey after high school. He **ended up** becoming a bank robber! (plans changed) 

**Tyra:** What? I don’t believe that! How did that happen? 

**Melanie:** It’s a sad story. After attending college for a couple of years he became disillusioned with the engineering field. He always loved dogs and decided to take a chance and follow his passion. He took out a loan to start his own business - grooming dogs. However, It was the wrong time. They say “timing is everything.” It was in 2008 and the financial crisis was happening in the United States and Nebraska was especially hit hard. 

People didn’t have any disposable income to spend getting their dogs groomed when they could do it at home. Unfortunately, business was slow and he was unable to **keep up** (continue) with the payments. He was doing everything on his own-grooming the dogs, paying the bills, ordering supplies and was unable to get anybody to **help out** in his business. (help).  

He was overwhelmed! He was in severe financial debt and as a last resort he robbed a bank. It **turned out** (unexpected result) that running a business was harder than he thought. 

**Tyra:** How tragic! Well are you going to **get together** (meet socially) with him? You are recently divorced from Donnie. Jeffrey was your first love. 

**Melanie:** He asked me to **cove over** (go to someone’s house) to his apartment this weekend! I said I would but I don’t think I am going to **show up** (arrive) because I don’t want to get involved in any drama. Hmmm. On second thought maybe I will drop by for a little while and if things get weird I’ll **take off** (leave).
