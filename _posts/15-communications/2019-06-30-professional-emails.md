# Professional Emails

## What is a structure?

- Salutation

- Body: Check in (Optional)

- Body

- Call to Action / Thank you

- Closing

  

## Salutation

### Formal

- Dear ___ (If you know the person’s name)
- Dear (Mr, Ms, Mrs + last name)
- Dear Sir or Madam, (**You don’t know the person’s name** and are contacting an organization)
- Dear director of ___, (Head of Information Technology Department / Director of Information Technology)

### Less formal

- Hello, (first name)
- Hi (most informal)



## Body: Check in (Optional)

Optional: You can start by briefly and concisely checking in on your contact.

> This is useful if you’ve recently had a conversation, if you’ve been working with this person for a while, or if you have a business relationship with this person already.  If not, it’s ok to skip this part. 

- **I hope all is well with you. (friendly)**
- I trust you are well. (slightly more formal)
- Thank you for your prompt response (quite formal)
- **Thank you for your email / your inquiry**
- **Thank you for your email requesting a meeting / consultation / informational meeting.**
- I hope that everything's going well on your end.



## Body

Briefly state your purpose for writing in the very beginning of your message.

>  Be sure to provide the reader with some context. If you’re asking a question, cut and paste any relevant text (for example, computer error messages, assignment prompts you don’t understand, part of a previous message, etc.) into the email so that the reader has some frame of reference for your question. When replying to someone else’s email, it can often be helpful to either include or restate the sender’s message.



This will vary of course depending on your line of work, your request.  But there are few guidelines:

- Go straight to the point.
- Be clear and concise.
- Use diplomatic language whenever possible. (Be aware of what’s polite in requests and soften your language slightly. English speakers use a number of softeners)



#### Examples

- I am writing in response to your recent inquiry for more information.

- I am writing to ask if you would be interested in.



## Call to Action / Thank you

What would you like this person to do?

> Finally, state the desired outcome at the end of your message. If you’re requesting a response, let the reader know what type of response you require (for example, an email reply, possible times for a meeting, a recommendation letter, etc.) If you’re requesting something that has a due date, be sure to highlight that due date in a prominent position in your message.

#### Thank you

- **Thanks for your hard work on this!**
- Thank you for your assistance with…
- Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.
- Thank you for contacting ___ (company name)
- Thank you for your interest
- **Please feel free to call me (contact me by email / contact me directly) if you have any questions.**
- Please let me know if there is a time you’d like to meet to discuss this further.

Dear colleagues,

The next meeting of the Board will be held at our head office in Moscow on Friday, November 2nd at 9:00am.

I would be very grateful if you would let my assistant, Rachel, know as soon as possible whether you will be able to attend. It is essential that we have a minimum of 8 members attend the meeting since we need to vote on several issues which affect the future development of the company.

As usual, my assistant will make all accomodation hotel arrangements. Please send flight details when you reply so she can inform the hotel of approximate arrival times.

The agenda will be distributed three weeks before the meeting.

I look forward to seeing you on November 2nd.

Best regards,

Sergey Ivankov

I would like to schedule the videoconference for next Tuesday at 2:00pm EST. Does anybody have a problem with that? Just give me a ring today if it’s not ok.

We will need to cover the following points:
- Design of new logo
- Marketing online strategy 

See you all on Tuesday.

Cheers,
Tiffany

### Example 2

Hi Jackie,

Thanks for sending that report last week. I read it yesterday, and I feel that Chapter 2 needs more specific information about our sales figures.

I also felt that the tone could be more formal.

Could you amend it with these comments in mind?
Thanks for your hard work on this!

Monica
