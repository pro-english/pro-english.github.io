# Future Tense

Будующее в английском языке может быть выражено тремя конструкциями:

1. be going to + infinitive
2. present continuous: be + verb + -ing
3. will / shall + infinitive



## be going to + infinitive

**Be going to** используется для выражения:

- future plans (планов)
- intensions (намерений)
- predictions (предсказаний)

> **Future plans and intentions**
>
> 1. My sister's going to adopt a child.
> 2. Are you going to buy a new car or a second-hand one?

>**Predications**
>
>1. Barcelona are going to win. They're playing really well.
>2. Look at those black clouds. I think it's going to rain.

- We use going to (NOT will / won't) when we have already decided to do something. ~~My sister will adopt a child.~~
- We also use *going to* to make a predication about the future, especially when you can see or have some evidence (доказательства) (e. g. black clouds)



## present continuous: be + verb + -ing

**Present continuous** используется для обозначения каких-либо договоренностей в будующем (future arrangements).

> **Future arrangements**
>
> 1. Lorna and Jamie are getting married in October.
> 2. We're meeting at 10.00 tomorrow in Jack's office.
> 3. Jane's leaving on Friday and coming back next Tuesday.

- We often use the present continuous for future arrangements.

- There is very little difference between the present continuous and *going to* for future plans / arrangements, and often you can use either.

  - *going* to show that you have made a decision.

    We're going to get married next year.

  - the present continuous emphasizes (подчеркивает) that you have made arrangements.

    We're getting married on October 12th.

- We often use the present continuous with verbs relating to travel arrangements, e.g. *go*, *come*, *arrive*, *leave*, etc. 

  I'm going to Paris tomorrow and coming back on Tuesday.



## will / shall + infinitive

**Will / shall** используется для выражения

- instant decisions (моментальный решений)
- promises (обещаний)
- offers (предложений)
- predictions (предсказаний)
- future facts (будующий фактов)
- suggestions (предположений)

> 1. I'll have the steak (стейк). (instant decision)
>
>    I won't tell anybody where you are. (promise)
>
>    I'll carry that bag for you. (offer)
>
>    You'll love New York! (prediction)
>
>    I'll be at home all afternoon. (future fact)
>
> 2. Shall I help you with you homework? (offer)
>
>    Shall we eat out tonight? (suggestion)

1. We use will / won't (NOT the present simple) for instant decisions, promises, offers, and suggestions. NOT ~~I carry that bag for you.~~
   - We can also use will / won't for predictions, e.g. *I think Barcelona will win*, and to talk about facts, e.g. *The election will be on 1st March.*
2. We use shall (NOT will) with I and we for offers and suggestions when they are questions.


# Нюансы

## Prediction

Для предсказаний можно использовать *will* и *going to*. Если сущестуют доказательства (evidence) в настроящем, то предпочтительно использовать *going to* вместо *will*.

> 1. That little boy's cycling too fast. He **is going to fall** (~~will fall~~) off.
> 2. Med didn't study for the exam so she doesn't think she **is going to pass** (~~will pass~~) it.

## Think

Когда используется *think*, то предпочтительней использовать **will**.
